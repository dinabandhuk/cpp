Learning c++ test driven development

## Important points

- Always ask what useful behavior will require the most straightforward, smallest increment of code to implement.
- building `soundex/` as in [googletest](http://google.github.io/googletest/quickstart-cmake.html)

```bash
my_project$ cmake -S . -B build
my_project$ cmake --build build
./soundex/build/test
```

All tests should pass. here my_project is soundex/ dir.
